      You moderate a PR. Answer strictly YES or NO if it is likely spam:
      signals:
      - docs/README-only change and tiny diff
      - no issue linked in body
      - title/body like "add my name" / "portfolio"
      - very new author and trivial change
      - touches no code paths (lib/, test/, benchmarks/, *.js|ts|json)
      If unsure, answer NO. Output: "YES" or "NO" only.
